The Rental Management System is a full-stack web application developed to efficiently manage rental properties, tenants, and related operations. The frontend of the application is built using React.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface, while the backend is developed using Spring Boot, which exposes RESTful APIs to handle business logic and data processing. The application uses the H2 in-memory database, making it lightweight and easy to configure for development and testing purposes.

This project follows modern DevOps practices to ensure automation, reliability, and code quality. Source code is managed using GitHub, and a CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, which automatically triggers on code commits. The pipeline handles dependency installation, application build, and integrates SonarCloud/SonarQube for continuous code quality and static analysis to detect bugs, code smells, and security issues.

To maintain consistency across environments, the application is containerized using Docker, with separate Docker configurations for the React frontend and the Spring Boot backend. This approach ensures portability and simplifies deployment. The frontend application is deployed using Vercel, enabling fast and scalable delivery, while the backend can be deployed on any Docker-supported cloud platform.

Overall, this project demonstrates a complete full-stack application with effective DevOps integration, showcasing CI/CD automation, containerization, and continuous quality monitoring, making the system scalable, maintainable, and production-ready.
